# Bayesian Optimization for Function Maximization

## Non-Technical Summary

This project uses an intelligent search algorithm called Bayesian Optimization to find the maximum values of unknown mathematical functions. Think of it like finding the highest peak in a foggy mountain range where you can only take a limited number of measurements. The algorithm learns from each measurement to make smart decisions about where to look next, balancing exploration of new areas with exploitation of known promising regions. This approach is widely used in real-world applications like drug discovery, engineering design, and hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models, where evaluations are expensive or time-consuming.

## Dataset

### Primary Dataset: Initial Function Data

The project uses pre-generated initial data for 8 different optimization functions with varying dimensionality:

- **Function 1**: 2D input space (10 initial samples)
- **Function 2**: 2D input space (10 initial samples)
- **Function 3**: 3D input space (15 initial samples)
- **Function 4**: 4D input space (30 initial samples)
- **Function 5**: 4D input space (20 initial samples)
- **Function 6**: 5D input space (20 initial samples)
- **Function 7**: 6D input space (30 initial samples)
- **Function 8**: 8D input space (40 initial samples)

All inputs are normalized to the range [0, 1] and outputs represent function evaluations at those points.

### Reference Dataset: Gene Expression Bioinformatics

For biological applications context, the project references the [Gene Expression Bioinformatics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samira1992/gene-expression-bioinformatics-dataset) from Kaggle, which demonstrates real-world applications of similar optimization techniques in:
- Gene expression analysis
- Biomarker discovery
- Disease classification

**Note**: The gene expression dataset is referenced for context but not directly used in the optimization tasks. It illustrates real-world applications where Bayesian Optimization is valuable for hyperparameter tuning of bioinformatics models.

## Methodology

### Bayesian Optimization Framework

The project implements a custom `BayesianOptimizer` class that:

1. **Surrogate Model**: Uses Gaussian Process Regression with Matérn kernel to model the unknown function
2. **Acquisition Functions**: 
   - Expected Improvement (EI): Balances exploration and exploitation
   - Upper Confidence Bound (UCB): Provides confidence-based exploration
3. **Optimization Strategy**: Iteratively suggests new points to evaluate based on the acquisition function
4. **Adaptive Approach**: Adjusts parameters based on problem dimensionality and optimization progress

### Key Components

- **Gaussian Process Regression**: Models uncertainty in function predictions
- **Acquisition Function Optimization**: Finds the next best point to sample
- **Sequential Decision Making**: Builds knowledge iteratively with limited evaluations
- **Exploration-Exploitation Balance**: Optimizes the trade-off between searching new areas and refining known good regions

## Usage

### Running the Main Notebook

Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Bayesian_optimisation-capsotne.ipynb
```

The notebook is organized into sections:

1. **Setup and Imports**: Load necessary libraries
2. **Data Loading**: Load initial function data
3. **Bayesian Optimizer Class**: Core implementation
4. **Optimization Runs**: Execute optimization for each function
5. **Analysis and Visualization**: Analyze results and compare strategies
6. **Final Submissions**: Generate optimized queries

### Example Usage

```python
from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import Matern
import numpy as np

# Initialize optimizer for function 1
optimizer = BayesianOptimizer(function_id=1, seed=42)

# Get next point suggestion using Expected Improvement
next_point = optimizer.suggest_next_point(acquisition_func='ei')

# Format for submission
query = optimizer.format_query(next_point)
print(f"Next query point: {query}")
```

## Results

The Bayesian Optimization approach successfully:

- Identified optimal or near-optimal regions for all 8 test functions
- Efficiently utilized limited function evaluations (budget varies by function)
- Demonstrated robust performance across different dimensionalities (2D to 8D)
- Achieved consistent improvement through iterative learning

Key performance metrics and visualizations are available in the main notebook, including:
- Optimization progress plots
- Acquisition function landscapes
- Convergence analysis
- Comparative performance across different strategies

## Documentation

- **[MODEL_CARD.md](MODEL_CARD.md)**: Model card detailing the Bayesian Optimizer, its intended use, limitations, and ethical considerations
- **[docs/methodology.md](docs/methodology.md)**: Detailed methodology and theoretical background

## Key Learnings

1. **Gaussian Processes**: Powerful probabilistic models for function approximation with uncertainty quantification
2. **Acquisition Functions**: Critical for balancing exploration vs exploitation
3. **Dimensionality Challenges**: Higher dimensions require more samples and adaptive strategies
4. **Reproducibility**: Careful seed management ensures reproducible results

## Future Improvements

- Add multi-objective optimization capabilities
- Incorporate constraint handling for real-world applications
- Develop parallel/batch Bayesian Optimization for multiple simultaneous evaluations
- Apply to real bioinformatics problems using gene expression data
